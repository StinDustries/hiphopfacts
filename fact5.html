<h3 style="text-align:center; background-color:white;" id="hiphopfact">Hip Hop History Fact 5: Like the four pillars of hip-hop, there are four pillars of b-boying. The first pillar is called Uprocking. This is all the footwork that happens when the dancer is standing. The second pillar is called Downrocking. This is all the footwork and the hand placement that happens when the dancer is on the ground. The third pillar is Power Moves. These are moves that the dancer does in their set to inspire awe in the viewers, such as flips, splits, spins, etc. The fourth and final pillar is Freezing/Suicides. These moves are meant to show the dancer's control over his moves. For instance, a dancer will freeze in a pose that is unnatural to show their balance, or fake something going wrong just to twist out of it at the last moment (suicides). The reason that Freezes and Suicides are only one pillar and not two seperate pillars are because they each deal with the same brand of control.</h3>
